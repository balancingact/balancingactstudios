    'about': 'This is the Alley, with the Old Man composited on top using the rain as a mask.  It was made entirely with Blender and its Cycles render.  I don\'t remember where I came up with this idea, but I thought it would be really cool to have a picture of an alley and in the rain you could faintly see the face of an old man.  So this is what came of that.  It turned out pretty well for my skill level at the time.  It was really hard to get decent looking rain in cycles though... I hope to re-do this some time in the future so I can get a more impressive and powerful result.'

I originally had modeled a creepy looking guy to sit on the chair but I couldn\'t get him to look very realistic so he just took away from the piece... Turns out it actually looks really nice with just the chair.  Made with Blender and the Cycles render engine.  Also some post-processing in photoshop for the dust specs and what not.  Also, I didn\'t make the graffiti on the side that is a big face eating another face.  That\'s just a photo of some random graffiti in Barcelona that I found online.'

And there are lots of little details that you probably can\'t even see... Like his shoe laces, and the Library... Anyway, I made that lampost for the Man In The Rain image that I made awhile ago and really liked it.  So that essentially inspired this photo because I wanted to do something that was kind of based around that lampost, and I\'ve actually used that lampost in everything I\'ve made since then, and plan to keep doing so!'

I wish I had more power so I could\'ve added more detail... But it still turned out pretty great.
